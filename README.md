# KickOff [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frickelbruder/kickoff.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/frickelbruder/kickoff) [![Current packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/frickelbruder/kickoff.svg?style=flat)](https://packagist.org/packages/frickelbruder/kickoff)  
_A continuous website monitoring tool._

## Why Kickoff
You launch projects on a regular basis and have certain SEO, performance and security requirements which your websites should meet.
Those could be:
- Provide an X-XSS-Protection header.
- Deliver an HTML document in less than 1 second.
- Your redirects should use a 301 header
- Your cookie should be accessible via Http only
- Your title tag should only have 70 characters
- [...]

So this tool aims to automate the process of checking all your requirements short before launch or after the deployment, so you can just click on deliver in your CI and sit back and see your websites becoming popular.
Kickoff can be integrated into your standard delivery process (such as with jenkins, travis or any other) to keep those requirements even after the launch day, so that your requirements won't get accidentally dissatisfied.
As such, you can call KickOff a continous website monitoring tool.

## Integration into CD
```
./bin/kickoff.php run -j build/logs/kickoff.xml example/security.yml
```
This generates a Junit compatible log file, which can be injected into a CD workflow as for example phpunit.
The command itself will return the number of errors as result. So any errors should result in a failing build target.
